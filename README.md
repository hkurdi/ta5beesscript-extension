Example snippet (Ta5beesScript):
\`\`\`ta5bees

## Why I Made This Language

I was just sitting there, rewatching Charles Oliveira vs. Islam Makhachev for the fifth time instead of studying for my final that is the next day, Somewhere between rounds, I thought, "What if I made a programming language in Arabeezi? Like, just to say I did it hahaha. And maybe to mess with people who take TypeScript way too seriously."

Let’s talk about TypeScript for a second. It’s like that strict teacher who insists you show your work on every single step, even when the answer is obvious. Half the time, the error messages read like ancient hieroglyphics, and the other half, you're just arguing with the compiler about things you both know are true.

Anyways to ensure Ta5beesScript doesn’t collapse after khalli x = 5;, it was built on TypeScript.

Ahahahahah.

## Requirements

- **VS Code 1.50+** (to ensure proper extension handling).
- **Node.js** (if you plan to compile or run Ta5beesScript with additional tools).
- No special system dependencies—just your sense of humor.

---

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `ta5bees.enable`: Enable/disable the Ta5bees extension.
- `ta5bees.lintOnSave`: Lint your .ta5bees files upon saving.
- `ta5bees.snippets`: Toggle built-in code snippets.

---

## Known Issues

- **Deep** IntelliSense is limited—this is basically a comedic side project, not the next big enterprise language.  
- **Refactoring Tools** are minimal because we’re still mocking TypeScript (and maybe ourselves).
